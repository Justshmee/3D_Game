# Overview

This is a 3D version of the game I made a couple weeks before, where you just dodge creatures in a 2D space. In this 3D version instead of raising your score by dodging around for each second, you raise your score by jumping on the enemies like in mario.

I made this to get more comfortable with Godot and GDScript.

# Development Environment

I used Godot and a tutorial to help make this.

I used GDScript for the programming language.

# Useful Websites
* [godotengine](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html)

# Future Work
* The animation of the character and enemies is still a little choppy.
* Add different types of enemies.
* Make the ground more expressive.
